The data deletion policy may be implemented with respect to any or all of the Services. Each Service will be considered an independent and separate service for the purpose of calculating the period of inactivity. In other words, activity in one of the Services is not sufficient to keep your user account in another Service active. In case of accounts with more than one user, if at least one of the users is active, the account will not be considered inactive.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Data Ownership</h2>

But you grant Spottitt permission to access, copy, distribute, store, transmit, reformat, publicly display and publicly perform the content of your user account solely as required for the purpose of providing the Services to you.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Hosting Location</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">The location of the cloud facility from which you are served depends on the mapping of your region/country to the available cloud facilities at the time of your sign-up. We may migrate your account or require you to migrate your account to a different cloud facility in the event of any updates to the region/country to cloud facility mapping at any point of time. You must not mask your internet protocol (IP) address at the time of sign-up since your region.</p>
